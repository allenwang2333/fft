# FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation)
## Features
* Traditionally, Discrete Fourier Transformation has time complexity of O(N^2)  
* Fast Fourier Transformation has time complexity of O(NlogN)  
## Usage
* This repo supports both dft and fft
* functional for both real and imaginary signals
* to use for only real signals, set imaginary part to 0
